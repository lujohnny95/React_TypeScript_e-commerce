## Description
Application of React with typescript to build a simple shopping cart with an add to cart functionality. 
Frameworks and packages used: React (TypeScript), Material-UI, Styled-Component, useQuery (react-query), fakestore API.

- React for building the individual, reusable components with dynamic states: Item, Cart, CartItem.
- TypeScript for more robust code, less prone to type errors, as datatypes needed to be specified. 
- Styled components used for styling individual elements within the components. Cart icons, loading component and features such as the Appbar and Drawer were imported from material-UI.
- useQuery was used to fetch, cache and update asynchronous data - from the fakestore API (containing made-up e-commerce product data).
